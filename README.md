A Multi-Modal Prompt Learning Framework for Early Detection of Fake News.
==== 
Datasets
-------  
We use three benchmark fake news detection datasets with multiple modalities to evaluate the performance of our method, namely, Twitter, GossipCop, and PolitiFact. These three datasets are real datasets collected from multiple social platforms. The Twitter dataset (Boididou et al. 2015, 2018) consists of tweets that include text information, visual information, and social context information. The PolitiFact and GossipCop datasets are two English datasets collected from the politics and entertainment domains, respectively, in the FakeNewsNet repository(Shu, Wang, and Liu 2017; Shu et al. 2017, 2020). The PolitiFact dataset is a
dataset about political news, which experts identify as real or fake news. Meanwhile, GossipCop tells entertainment stories with scores ranging from 0 to 10, and the authors of the FakeNewsNet consider scores below 5 to be fake news.
